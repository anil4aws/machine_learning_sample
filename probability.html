# Probablity 

Anticipate traffic , anticipate the uncertainity .   
Supplier to avoid missing business can stockup based on probablity . 
probability can help in pricing .

P(E) = Number of favorable outcome / Total number of possible outcome 

Mutually Exclusive : Card of spade and card of Heart are mutually exclusive 

Totally exclusive : Events are totally exclusive if atleast one of the events will occur 


## Appraches to arrival of probablity 

## Classical approach
p(A) in n mutually exclusive, equally likely outcomes with k implying outcomes is k/n 
probablity of drawing club = 13/52 
## Relative approach
Fraction of times it has occured in serveral experiment trails  ; defective piece probable = 5/1000 

probablity of event is estimated using the subjective judgement of expert 


# Conditional probality 

Likelihood of event depends on the occurence or non-occurence of related events 
Crop yield on rain . 

p(A|B} = Probability that Event A occurs givn event B occurs 

Black spade  = 13/52 and p(b) = 26/52
p{A|B} = Pr(A∩B}/Pr{B}  = (13/52) / (26/52)

# Types of events 

## complement of events 

Complemt of event A is Set of outcomes that do not imply the event A.A′ or Ac
## Independent Events 

In set of cards , probablity of picking King is independent of selecting King of spade . so they are independent events 

probablity of selecting king is 4/52 = 1/13 
Probability of selecting Spade = 13/52 and one way to chose king . Hence probablity of Pr(A|B) = Pr(A) . Occurence of king does not dependent whether card is spade , club , hear...in other words events are independent .

Pr(A|B)=Pr(A|Bc)= Pr(A)
Pr(A′|B) = Pr(A'|B')= Pr(A')
Pr(B|A)=Pr(B|A')= Pr(B)
Pr(B'|A) = Pr(B'|A')= Pr(B')

## Dependent Events 

Red diamond card = Pr(C) = 13/52

Pr(C|D)= 13/26)

13/52 != 13/26 So theya are dependent events 


# Addition theorem of probablity 

when A and B are two events which are not mutually exclusive 
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B):
If in an apartment , 0.6 percent get paper x and 0.45 get paper z then probablity of houses with both type is . And 80% are getting paper

so p(A and B) = 0.25



# Multiplication theorem of probablity 
Independent events = Pr(A∩B}= Pr{A}*Pr{B}
Pr(A∩B}= Pr{A|B}*Pr{B}

# Bayes theorem 

If a product will be successful

A1,A2,A3...An = Mutually and totally exclusive events with known probability 

B is another event Pr{B|Aj} (j=1 to n)  then 

Pr{Ak|B} = ( Pr{B|Ak}*Pr{Ak}) /   Σ(j=1 to n) ( Pr{B|Aj}*Pr{Aj})
