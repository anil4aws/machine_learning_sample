## Supervised-Learning
Uses labeled data to train machine learning models.
Eg : Netflix ,  decision tree, logistic regression, linear regression, support vector machine
### Classification
Classifies data into classes eg speech recognition , face detection 
### Regression
Relation between independent variables (Features) and dependent variables (outcomes ) eg predictive continous 

## UnSupervised-Learning
Deals with unlabelled data to identify the pattern 
Eg :Clustering perhaps customer cluster 
### Clustering
Grouping similar ones with distances or others like k-means 
### Association 
Associates based on the rules 

## SemiSupervised-Learning
Is combination of supervised and unsupervised 
Eg : can take any supervised method for classification or regression and modify it to work in a semi-supervised manner, taking advantage of labeled and unlabeled data

## Data-Normalization
Feature scaling technique to standardize the  independent features/ variables present in the data in a fixed range
