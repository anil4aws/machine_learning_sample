<h1>RANDOM VARIABLE</h1>
Random variables are the values which depend upon the chances
Denoted by X and Y
Outcome of dice , number of defective piece are the examples of random variables
<br>
<h2>Discrete Random variables</h2>
Takes selected value in certain range
<h2>Continuous Random variables </h2>
Takes any value in certain range

<h2> Discrete Probability Distribution </h2>
Based on bernoulli trials and principals
1.Binomial distribution :
2.poisson distribution : Number of opportunities for outcomes cannot have upper limit , eg : Number of potential visitors in store .
X - random variable indicating the number of occurrences then p(x) 0,1,2... depends on expected value λ (lambda) .
λ (lambda) is parameter of distribution ,
when x follows poisson distribution with parameter λ (lambda)
E(X) = λ
Var(X) = λ
s.d.(X) = √λ

<h4>Binomial by poisson theorem </h4>

if n is very large and p is very small then
λ = n*p

<h4>Poisson probabilities </h4>
If X is the random variable number of occurrences in a given interval for which average rate of occurrence is λ then
P(X=r)=(e power(-λ) )*(r times λ)/r!   where r = 0,1,2,3

Find the probability of getting 3 or more defectives in a lot of 1000 when probability of getting defective is 0.005

X = n = 1000 ; p= 0.005 , since n is very large and p is very small
λ = n*p = 5

Pr{X>=3}=1-Pr{X>=2}
        = (e power(-5))*(5 to the power of 0)/O! +
              (e power(-5))*(5 to the power of 1)/1! +
                (e power(-5))*(5 to the power of 2)/2!
        = 0.87535

<h2> Continuous Probability Distribution </h2>
<h4>Uniform probability distribution </h4>
P(X) follows uniform distribution in range[a,b]
If the probability of lying in range [c,d] is directly proportional to the length
Pr{c<X<d} = d-c/b-a
a ... c ... d ..b

<h4>Normal distribution </h4>
Curve is symmetric about the population mean μ
