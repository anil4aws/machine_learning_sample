# Inferential Statistics 

Inferential statistics is used to find some information about population of data based on some samples 

AB testing is most commonly used 

Placing a button on top , or bottom 

if both perform well then it is null hypothesis

----------

A paired T Test show how a subject behaves in two different time spaces 
When people were given vitamin supplement they felt strong , earlier they were not . 


## Null(Ho) and Alternative Hypothesis(H1)

If sales promotion impacts - Ho - Negation of assertion 
If it impacts - Alternative Hypothesis  - Assertion 


## p value 

All time average of students score is 900 
with standard deviation of 180

if 200 sample take this year and if average > 900 i.e 950 then null hypothesis is rejected 

score of 200 , sd = 180/sqrt 200 = 12.72 

p-value is the ease with which null hypothesis is rejected

## level of significance 

level of significance at which you can reject Null hypthesis that level is p-value
