# Linear algebra 

Data is represented in linear equation which in turn are represented in matrices

For ML , there is need to reduce dimensions of data , choosing right parameters are required . here linear algebra helps 

### scalars

### vectors

we need magnitude and direction for describing veloctiy 
vectors can be added / multiplied 

if x=[x,x2,..] and y =[y1,y2,....]
then Dot product xy = [x1y1,x2y2,....]

||x|| = âˆšv.v 


## Matrix

Matrix represent a mathematical object or property of an object

#### transpose of matrix
obtained by interchanging x and y

To get echelon form :
1.Interchange two rows 
2.multiply a row by non-zero constant and 
3.multiple of a row to another row 


#### Determinant of matrix

Is a scalar quantity 

X = [Aij]
det x= a11 det A11 - a12 det A12 + ...

Eigen vectors 

Eigen vectors are vectors that are fixed in direction under a given linear transformation

Scaling factor of Eigen vector is eigen value 


## Calculus in Algebra 

Measures quantities like slopes of curve or object 

### Differential calculus 
In machine learning - Gradient dissent  - useful in backpropagation of neural networks - how the output of function changes when input changes 
### Inferential calculus 
Useful in  posterior in Bayesian model or to the bound the error in sequential decision  as per Neyman pearson Lemma 

calculus is important for developing an intuition for machine learning algorithm
